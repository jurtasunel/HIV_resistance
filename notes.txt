Preprocess:
-Rename duplicates
-Remove seqs below 75% of total gene length
-Plot coverage and exclude samples below 95%coverage

-Mafft the filtered fastas

Filtermuts:
-Read in spredsheet with mutations, and mafft aligned.
-Write out fasta of only samples with mutations
-Get piechart of mutations frequency

Phylotree:
-Make tree of the samples with mutations.
